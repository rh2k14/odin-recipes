    <ol>
        <li>Add oat milk to a large mug and microwave for 1 minute. Alternatively, add to a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once milk is warm, add cocoa powder, chocolate and sweetener and whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Put back in microwave or continue cooking on stovetop until completely combined and has reached your preferred temperature.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust sweetness as needed.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add in your extract of choice. I think peppermint is truly unbeatable. Stir, and top with coconut whipped cream.</li>
